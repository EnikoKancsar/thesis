## VSC Terminal conda activate not working

Open Windows Power Shell as administrator or Anaconda Prompt.
Go to the folder.
Activate the desired conda environment there.
Type `$ code` which will open VSC in the current folder.
Open the Terminal in VSC.
If the conda environment is not set already, the activate command should work correctly now after being started from the command line.
